# Economic Impact of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict on Key U.S. Indicators

### Overview

This project explores how the Russia-Ukraine conflict affected important U.S. economic indicators, like oil prices, stock market trends, consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations. By looking at time series data and creating visualizations, we aim to better understand how these variables changed during the conflict and what patterns emerged.

We used data from reliable sources like the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Kaggle’s S&P 500 data, and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to analyze the impact from February 2022 to now. The goal is to make these insights easy to understand with clear visuals and animations.

### Motivation

The Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused a lot of disruption globally, and its effects on the economy are a big concern for policymakers, businesses, and regular people. This project helps us see how events like this affect everyday things, like gas prices or stock performance, and how public confidence shifts in response.

### What We’re Trying to Do

- Show how the stock market and oil prices reacted to the conflict.
- Track how consumer confidence and inflation expectations changed over time.
- Find connections between these variables to tell a bigger story.

### What’s Inside

Folders

- `data`: Includes cleaned datasets used for analysis.
- `writeup.pdf`: Important project notes and references.
- `images`: All the cool graphs and visualizations we made.
- `code.qmd`: Scripts for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.

### Our Data Sources

We worked with three main datasets:
- S&P 500 Data (from Kaggle): Tracks daily stock market performance.
- Oil Price Data (from EIA): Weekly crude oil prices by U.S. region.
- Consumer Sentiment & Inflation Data (from FRED): Monthly measures of public confidence and inflation expectations.

We combined these datasets after cleaning them to make a single file for our analysis.
