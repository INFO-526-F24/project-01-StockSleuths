    "text": "Datasets\nWe aim to analyze the impact of the Russia/Ukraine war on the U.S. economy by focusing on oil prices and stock market trends from prior to the conflict, the beginning of the conflict (February 2022), and up to present day. To do this, we will use three primary datasets: one from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) containing data on U.S. crude oil prices, a Kaggle dataset tracking S&P 500 stock market data, and a dataset from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) on U.S. consumer sentiment.\nThese datasets will provide key insights into how these critical economic factors have shifted since the onset of the conflict, enabling a detailed exploration of potential correlations and trends. While the data is quantitative, we must consider if there might be underlying biases in the datasets that could skew results. For example, the consumer sentiment data could reflect certain demographic biases depending on how the data is collected, especially if it under represents certain groups of people.\nDataset 1: US Stock Market Data from Kaggle, sp500_stocks.csv (200 MB)  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks) \n\nsp500_data &lt;- read_csv('data/sp500_index.csv')\nglimpse(sp500_data)\n\nRows: 2,517\nColumns: 2\n$ Date     &lt;date&gt; 2014-10-13, 2014-10-14, 2014-10-15, 2014-10-16, 2014-10-17, …\n$ `S&P500` &lt;dbl&gt; 1874.74, 1877.70, 1862.49, 1862.76, 1886.76, 1904.01, 1941.28…\n\n\nThis dataset is updated daily and provides historical data, from as far back as 2010 up to current day, on the S&P 500, or Standard and Poor’s 500, which is one of the world’s most renowned financial benchmarks. This stock market index measures the performance of 500 major companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges, with the data originally being collected from FRED and Yahoo finance. Although it tracks 500 companies, the inclusion of multiple stock classes from some firms, such as Alphabet’s Class A (GOOGL) and Class C (GOOG), means the index actually comprises 505 stocks. Since this data is aggregated and anonymized, there are no privacy concerns for individual investors.\nDataset 2: EIA data pswrgvwall.xls (7 MB) https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/\n\noil_data &lt;- read_excel(\"data/pswrgvwall.xls\", sheet = \"Data 1\")\nglimpse(oil_data)\n\nRows: 1,784\nColumns: 21\n$ `Back to Contents`             &lt;chr&gt; \"Sourcekey\", \"Date\", \"33105\", \"33112\", …\n$ `Data 1: Regular Conventional` &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG\", \"Weekly U.S. R…\n$ ...3                           &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_R10_DPG\", \"Weekly East C…\n$ ...4                           &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_R1X_DPG\", \"Weekly New En…\n$ ...5                           &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_R1Y_DPG\", \"Weekly Centra…\n$ ...6                           &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_R1Z_DPG\", \"Weekly Lower …\n$ ...7                           &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_R20_DPG\", \"Weekly Midwes…\n$ ...8                           &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_R30_DPG\", \"Weekly Gulf C…\n$ ...9                           &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_R40_DPG\", \"Weekly Rocky …\n$ ...10                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_R50_DPG\", \"Weekly West C…\n$ ...11                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_SCO_DPG\", \"Weekly Colora…\n$ ...12                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_SFL_DPG\", \"Weekly Florid…\n$ ...13                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_SNY_DPG\", \"Weekly New Yo…\n$ ...14                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_SMN_DPG\", \"Weekly Minnes…\n$ ...15                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_SOH_DPG\", \"Weekly Ohio R…\n$ ...16                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_STX_DPG\", \"Weekly Texas …\n$ ...17                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_SWA_DPG\", \"Weekly Washin…\n$ ...18                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_YCLE_DPG\", \"Weekly Cleve…\n$ ...19                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_YDEN_DPG\", \"Weekly Denve…\n$ ...20                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_YMIA_DPG\", \"Weekly Miami…\n$ ...21                          &lt;chr&gt; \"EMM_EPMRU_PTE_Y48SE_DPG\", \"Weekly Seat…\n\n\nThis dataset is from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and it provides historical data for crude oil prices in the US (spanning from the 1990s to present day), which has correlation with geopolitical events that affect supply and demand. It comes from a reputable government source, which means the data is considered reliable and transparent. However, it’s always essential to acknowledge any potential limitations or assumptions made in the data collection process by this agency, as such limitations could influence analysis and its conclusions.\nDataset 3: Consumer Sentiment & Inflation data from FRED umcsent.csv (501 bytes) and MICH.csv (8 KB) -merged together- https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MICH\n\nsent_data &lt;- read_csv('data/UMCSENT.csv')\ninflation_data &lt;- read_csv('data/MICH.csv')\nmerged_data &lt;- left_join(sent_data, inflation_data, by = 'DATE')\nglimpse(merged_data)\n\nRows: 862\nColumns: 3\n$ DATE    &lt;date&gt; 1952-11-01, 1952-12-01, 1953-01-01, 1953-02-01, 1953-03-01, 1…\n$ UMCSENT &lt;chr&gt; \"86.2\", \".\", \".\", \"90.7\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \"80.8\", \".\"…\n$ MICH    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n\n\nThese datasets are from the Federal Reserve of Economic Data and provide data on economic indicators such as consumer sentiment and inflation expectations, to show the influence of economic changes on the economy and how society reacts. It is updated monthly and for the purposes of our project, we pulled data from February 2022 to present day. The data also comes from a trusted government source, which generally makes it reliable and transparent. However, it’s important to recognize any potential limitations or assumptions in the agency’s data collection process, as these factors could impact the analysis and its conclusions.\nWe chose these datasets and this topic because some of our team members have a strong interest in how data science can be used in the financial industry. We believe it will be insightful to analyze the impacts of the Russia/Ukraine conflict on the US economy, specifically on stocks and oil prices. Our team agreed exploring this relationship would be a valuable and creative way to strengthen our data visualization skills."

    "section": "Analysis plan",
    "text": "Analysis plan\nQuestion 1 Approach: We will first analyze how US stock trends (through the US Stock Market Performance Measure) and oil prices have evolved since the beginning of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. We will visualize these trends using a time series plot and explore the relationship between stock trends and oil prices through a scatter plot. Before proceeding with the analysis, we will clean and preprocess the data to address any missing or inconsistent values, ensuring the datasets are ready for analysis. We will also conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify initial patterns and trends in the data. \nVariables:\n\nUS Stock Market Performance Measure (quantitative)\nOil prices (quantitative)\nTime since the start of the conflict (categorical or quantitative depending on how time is measured, e.g., by year/month or as a binary pre-/post-conflict variable)\n\nThis question is important because the Russia/Ukraine war has had significant global economic ramifications, particularly on energy markets and financial stability. Understanding the specific changes in U.S. oil and US Stock Market Performance Measure during this period can reveal the direct economic impact of geopolitical conflicts on the U.S. economy.\nQuestion 2 Approach: We will investigate how consumer sentiment has fluctuated alongside changes in US Stock Market Performance Measure and oil prices. This will involve using a box plot to capture the distribution of consumer sentiment and a line plot to reveal trends over time. By combining these visualizations with statistical analysis, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns and connections between the conflict and U.S. economic indicators.\nVariables:\n\nConsumer sentiment (quantitative)\nUS Stock Market Performance Measure (quantitative)\nOil prices (quantitative)\nInflation Expectations (quantitative) – from the FRED dataset\n\nThis question is crucial because consumer sentiment is a key indicator of economic health, reflecting public confidence in the economy and influencing spending and investment decisions. By examining how sentiment has shifted in relation to stock and oil price fluctuations, we can assess the broader psychological and behavioral impact of economic changes triggered by the conflict. By including inflation expectations, we aim to understand not only how people feel about the economy (consumer sentiment) but also how they perceive future inflationary pressures, giving a more rounded view of economic sentiment during the war. Understanding this relationship helps in anticipating consumer responses to market volatility, which is valuable for businesses, policymakers, and investors looking to gauge the potential economic trajectory during crises.\n\nHypotheses:\nOur project focuses on analyzing the economic impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict on key U.S. economic indicators such as oil prices, stock market trends, consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations. We will use datasets from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) for oil prices, Kaggle for S&P 500 stock market data, and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for consumer sentiment and inflation expectations. By comparing data from prior to the conflict, at the beginning (February 2022), and up to the present day, we aim to explore correlations between these economic variables and assess the broader impact of geopolitical instability on the U.S. economy.\n\nQuestion 1 Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the results of our data analysis will show that the onset of the Russia/Ukraine conflict has led to a significant increase in U.S. crude oil prices, driven by supply chain disruptions and heightened geopolitical risk.\nQuestion 2 Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the results of our data analysis will show that US Stock Market Performance Measure, consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations have experienced greater volatility and negative trends since the start of the conflict, with stock prices declining, consumer sentiment weakening, and inflation expectations rising in response to oil price increases and economic uncertainty."

The trend line in the graph suggests a negative correlation, meaning that as oil prices increase, S&P 500 prices tend to decrease. However, the points on the graph are quite spread out, which means the relationship is not very strong or consistent. This could indicate that while oil prices might have some impact on the S&P 500, there are likely other factors at play, such as changes in the economy, interest rates, or global events. Overall, the graph shows that there might be a slight connection between oil prices and stock performance, but it’s not strong enough to say one directly causes the other.\n\n\n\nOil Prices and S&P500 Trends from 2021 to 2023.\n\noil &lt;- read_csv(\"data/cleaned_oil_data.csv\")\nsp500 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/sp500_index.csv\")\n\nstart_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2021-01-01\")\nend_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-01-01\")\n\noil_filtered &lt;- oil %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= start_date & date &lt;= end_date)\n\nsp500_filtered &lt;- sp500 %&gt;%\n  filter(Date &gt;= start_date & Date &lt;= end_date)\n\noil_filtered &lt;- oil_filtered %&gt;%\n  rename(Date = date)\n\nsp500_filtered &lt;- sp500_filtered %&gt;%\n  rename(SP500 = `S&P500`)\n\ncombined_data &lt;- oil_filtered %&gt;%\n  inner_join(sp500_filtered, by = \"Date\") %&gt;%\n  select(Date, oil_price, SP500)\n\ncombined_data$Date &lt;- as.Date(combined_data$Date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\ncombined_data &lt;- combined_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Date) & !is.na(oil_price) & !is.na(SP500))\n\nhighlight_period &lt;- data.frame(\n  xmin = as.Date(\"2022-02-24\"),\n  xmax = as.Date(\"2022-03-31\"),\n  ymin = -Inf,  # Extends shading to bottom of the plot\n  ymax = Inf    # Extends shading to top of the plot\n)\n\n# Rescale oil_price to match SP500 range\ncombined_data &lt;- combined_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(oil_price_rescaled = oil_price * (max(SP500) / max(oil_price)))\n\nanimated_plot &lt;- ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Date)) +\n  geom_rect(\n    data = highlight_period,\n    aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax),\n    fill = \"lightgray\", alpha = 0.3, inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = oil_price_rescaled, color = \"Oil Prices\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = SP500, color = \"S&P 500\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = oil_price_rescaled, color = \"Oil Prices\"), size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = SP500, color = \"S&P 500\"), size = 2, alpha = 0.7) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Oil Prices\" = \"red\", \"S&P 500\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Oil Prices and S&P 500 Trends from 2021 Until 2023\",\n       x = \"Date\", y = \"Price\", color = NULL ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b %Y\", \n               date_breaks = \"5 months\") + \n  transition_reveal(Date) +\n  ease_aes('cubic-in-out') + \n  annotate(\"text\", \n         x = as.Date(\"2022-03-10\"), \n         y = min(combined_data$SP500, na.rm = TRUE) - 200, # Inside shaded area\n         label = \"Period of Conflict\", \n         color = \"black\", size = 5, fontface = \"italic\", angle = 90) + \n  annotate(\"text\",\n  x = max(combined_data$Date) - 30,  \n  y = min(combined_data$oil_price_rescaled),  \n  label = \"Oil Prices Rescaled for Comparison\",\n  color = \"red\",\n  size = 2.5,\n  hjust = 1) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 8),  \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),   \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n# animate(animated_plot, nframes = 300, fps = 20, width = 800, height = 600, renderer = av_renderer(videos/animated_time_series_q1.mp4\"))\n# Render and save the animation as a GIF\nanimate(animated_plot, renderer = gifski_renderer(\"images/stocks_vs_oil.gif\"), height = 600, width = 800, units = \"px\", duration = 10, fps = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Sentiment and Oil price trends over time\n\n#Stock market\nsp500_data &lt;- read_csv('data/sp500_index.csv') \nsp500_data$Date &lt;- as.Date(sp500_data$Date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\nsp500_data &lt;- sp500_data |&gt;\n  rename(DATE = Date)\nglimpse(sp500_data)\n\nRows: 2,517\nColumns: 2\n$ DATE     &lt;date&gt;

As inflation surged, consumer confidence declined, highlighting the impact of rising costs on public perception.\nConsumer sentiment was already in a decline trend probably due to COVID caused by economic uncertainty and inflation pressures. Consumer sentiment drops more sharply during the conflict, reaching its lowest levels. This suggests that the war might have intensified concerns about economic stability, inflation, and geopolitical risks.\nBefore the conflict there was gradual increase in inflation likely due to COVID-19 but we can see a sharp increase in it when the war started at full scale which is probably due to global supply chain disruptions\n\n\n\n\nStocks and Inflation Trends During Russia Ukraine Conflict\n\noptions(warn = FALSE)\n\n# Adding a range to mark the Russia-Ukraine war period\nwar_start &lt;- as.Date(\"2022-02-01\")\nwar_end &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-12-31\")\n\n#Re-scaling the inflation index so that we have only 1 y-axis and its easier to compare\nscale_factor &lt;- max(plot_data$UMCSENT, na.rm = TRUE) / max(plot_data$MICH, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Creating an animated line plot using ggplot and gganimate\nanimated_plot &lt;- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = DATE)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = UMCSENT, color = \"Consumer Sentiment\"), size = 1.2) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = MICH * scale_factor, color = \"Inflation\"), size = 1.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = war_start, xmax = war_end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = \"gray80\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  #

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe motivation for this analysis centers on understanding the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on key U.S. economic indicators, with a specific focus on oil prices, stock market trends, consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations. The research seeks to address how stock market trends and oil prices have changed since the onset of the conflict, and how consumer sentiment, stock trends, oil prices, and inflation expectations have shifted over time throughout the conflict. By exploring these questions, the analysis aims to shed light on the broader economic ripple effects of geopolitical instability, providing valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and investors.\n\nQuestions\nQuestion 1: How have US Stock Market trends and oil prices changed since the beginning of the Russia/Ukraine Conflict?\nQuestion 2: How has consumer sentiment, stock trends, oil prices, and inflation expectations changed over time during the Russia/Ukraine conflict?\n\n\nData\nWe leveraged three key datasets: U.S. crude oil price data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), S&P 500 stock market data from Kaggle, and consumer sentiment data and inflation expectation data merged into one set from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). These datasets provide valuable insights into how key economic indicators have changed during the conflict, allowing for a thorough analysis of potential patterns and relationships. However, it’s important to acknowledge potential biases that could influence the results. For example, consumer sentiment data might reflect demographic imbalances based on how it was collected, especially if certain population groups are underrepresented. Details on the datasets can be found the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nKey Variables\nDescription\nPurpose\nSource\n\n\n\n\nS&P 500 Stock Market Data\nDate, S&P 500 Index\nDaily updates on S&P 500 performance from 2010 to present, tracking 500 U.S. companies. Used to analyze market volatility from geopolitical events.\nTrack fluctuations in U.S. stock market performance to evaluate volatility linked to geopolitical events.\nKaggle (sp500_stocks.csv)\n\n\nU.S. Crude Oil Prices (EIA)\nWeekly crude oil prices by region (U.S. average, Midwest, Gulf Coast, etc.)\nHistorical U.S. crude oil prices from the 1990s to present, tracking price changes by region. Used to assess oil price shifts caused by global supply chain disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nMonitor oil price changes driven by global supply chain disruptions during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nU.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\n\n\nConsumer Sentiment & Inflation Expectations (FRED)\nConsumer sentiment index, Inflation expectations\nMonthly data on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations from February 2022 to present. Used to analyze shifts in public confidence and inflation expectations during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nAnalyze changes in consumer sentiment and inflation expectations in response to economic uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) Merged Sets\n\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning & Processing\nThe data cleaning and preprocessing phase was carefully designed to ensure the datasets were consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis. First, the S&P 500 dataset was standardized by formatting the date column and renaming columns to improve clarity and align with other datasets. A similar process was applied to the inflation and consumer sentiment merged datasets, creating a uniform structure across all sources for easier integration. For the oil price data, which was initially spread across multiple Excel sheets, all sheets were consolidated into one dataset. From this merged dataset, we selected “Weekly U.S. Regular Conventional Retail Gasoline Prices (Dollars per Gallon)” as the primary metric, focusing on a representative indicator of oil price trends.\nOnce the individual datasets were cleaned, they were merged by the date column to create a comprehensive dataset that included the S&P 500 index, inflation rates, and consumer sentiment. This merging step allowed us to analyze relationships and patterns across these economic indicators over time, providing a holistic view of their interdependencies.\nTo maintain data integrity, rows containing missing values (NA) were removed from all datasets to avoid distortions in the analysis. Column names were also standardized across all datasets to ensure consistency and make the data more interpretable. The final cleaned and merged dataset was saved as a CSV file, making it ready for exploration and ensuring the entire process could be easily reproduced. Full details of the cleaning and merging process, including specific transformations and code, are documented in the code.qmd file for complete transparency.\n\nThe exploratory data analysis (EDA) focused on examining trends and relationships between variables central to our research questions: oil prices, stock market trends (S&P 500), consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations. Through a combination of visualizations and summary statistics, the EDA provided valuable insights into these economic indicators. This EDA process provided an essential foundation for identifying relationships and patterns in the data, setting the stage for deeper analysis and interpretation of the economic indicators. Additionally, descriptive statistics were calculated for oil prices, providing key insights into the central tendency and variability of prices. Metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values were summarized to offer a clear overview of oil price distributions."

    "text": "Methodology\nTo address Question 1, the analysis focused on visualizing trends in U.S. crude oil prices and the S&P 500 index over time using time series plots. These visualizations highlight fluctuations in key economic indicators before, during, and after the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. A scatter plot was also employed to explore potential correlations between oil prices and stock prices, providing insight into how these two variables may influence one another.\nFor Question 2, line plots were used to track trends in consumer sentiment, inflation expectations, stock prices, and oil prices, allowing for a clear comparison of shifts in these variables in response to the conflict. Box plots illustrated the distribution of consumer sentiment across distinct time periods, particularly pre- and post-conflict, shedding light on changes in public confidence due to geopolitical instability.\nThe animated time series plot of oil prices and the S&P 500 index (rescaled for comparison) highlighted key trends from 2021 to 2023, with the conflict period marked in gray. This visualization emphasized oil price volatility, stock market reactions, and the broader economic impact of the conflict. Similarly, the box plot of consumer sentiment and rescaled oil prices (featuring a smoothed loess line) from 2020 to 2024 provided insights into shifts in sentiment, with interactive features allowing users to explore metrics such as medians, quartiles, and outliers. An animated line plot comparing trends in inflation and the S&P 500 index from early 2021 to late 2023 further demonstrated dynamic changes over time, with moving points highlighting inflection points and major shifts.\nThese visualizations were carefully chosen to align with the research questions and data structure. Time series plots effectively depict longitudinal trends, while scatter plots highlight relationships between variables. Box plots reveal shifts in distribution and behavior, offering insights into consumer sentiment and inflation during the conflict. The use of animation and interactivity enhances the storytelling aspect, enabling deeper exploration of specific data points and relationships. This thoughtful combination of techniques ensures a comprehensive and intuitive understanding of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on U.S. economic indicators."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n📈 Oil Prices: Spiked in early 2022 due to supply disruptions, fluctuating through 2023. 📉 S&P 500: Volatile, with sharp declines in early 2022 and partial recoveries later. 🔗 Correlation: Oil price spikes coincided with stock market downturns, showing financial impact.\n\n\nQuestion 2\n📊 Consumer Sentiment: Dropped significantly during the conflict, reflecting economic worries.\n🔥 Inflation: Climbed steadily, peaking during the conflict as oil prices soared.\n🔍 Visual Insights: Trends reveal oil price shifts influenced both public sentiment and market performance.\n\n\nAnimated Time Series Line Plot: Trends in Oil Prices and S&P 500 (2021–2023)\nThis animated plot highlights significant trends in oil prices and the S&P 500 index, emphasizing the influence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on these key economic indicators. Oil prices steadily increased before the conflict, peaking sharply around February 2022. This peak reflects global supply chain disruptions and reduced exports from Russia due to sanctions. Post-peak, oil prices declined, indicating adjustments in global markets, potentially through alternative supply strategies.\nThe S&P 500 index exhibited marked volatility during this period, with notable downturns coinciding with oil price spikes. This suggests market instability driven by heightened energy costs and geopolitical uncertainty. Despite moments of recovery, stock market fluctuations persisted, reflecting long-term economic concerns. These observations underscore how the conflict disrupted energy markets and amplified stock market instability, directly addressing Research Question 1 by linking geopolitical events to economic trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Box Plot: Consumer Sentiment and Oil Prices Over Time (2020–2024)\nThis plot illustrates the interplay between consumer sentiment (box plots) and rescaled oil prices (smoothed green line). Consumer sentiment displayed significant fluctuations, with higher values in 2020 and early 2021, followed by a notable decline during the conflict in 2022. This drop likely reflects public concerns about rising costs and economic uncertainty.\nOil prices, represented by the smoothed line, show a steep rise peaking in 2022 before steadily declining. The inverse relationship between oil prices and consumer sentiment during the conflict is evident—higher oil prices correlate with lower public confidence. By 2024, consumer sentiment begins to recover but remains below pre-conflict levels, indicating lingering economic apprehensions. These findings directly address Research Question 2, showcasing how geopolitical instability influenced consumer sentiment and energy markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter Plot: Relationship Between Oil Prices and S&P 500 Prices (2022)\nThe scatter plot visualizes the relationship between oil prices and the S&P 500 index during 2022, revealing a slight negative correlation. The trend line indicates that increases in oil prices were generally associated with declines in the stock market. However, the scattered data points highlight significant variability, suggesting that factors beyond oil prices also influenced market performance.\nThis relationship aligns with broader economic dynamics, where rising oil prices—linked to geopolitical tensions—raised production costs and dampened investor confidence. The plot provides a visual connection to Research Question 1 by emphasizing the interplay between energy markets and stock market trends during the conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimated Line Plot: S&P 500 and Inflation Trends During the Conflict (2021–2023)\nThis plot captures the evolution of the S&P 500 index and inflation trends during the conflict. The stock market initially showed gradual growth, but volatility intensified after the conflict began, with periodic dips corresponding to geopolitical uncertainty. Inflation trends sharply increased leading up to and during the conflict, peaking shortly after its onset, likely driven by energy market disruptions and supply chain challenges.\nPost-peak, inflation began to stabilize, though it remained elevated, reflecting persistent economic pressures. The stock market, in contrast, continued to exhibit volatility, signaling sustained investor uncertainty. This visualization supports Research Question 2 by highlighting how the conflict influenced inflation expectations and stock market performance, revealing the interconnectedness of these variables during a period of instability."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe analysis provided valuable insights into how the Russia-Ukraine conflict impacted key U.S. economic indicators, including stock market trends, oil prices, consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations. Each visualization shed light on specific aspects of these dynamics, addressing the research questions and painting a clearer picture of the economic ripple effects caused by geopolitical instability.For RQ1, which investigated changes in U.S. stock market trends and oil prices:\n\nThe animated time series plot revealed sharp oil price spikes in early 2022, coinciding with the onset of the conflict. These disruptions were likely driven by sanctions on Russian exports and broader supply chain instability. This visualization emphasized the direct influence of the conflict on energy markets and, indirectly, on the broader economy.\nThe S&P 500 exhibited notable volatility during the same period. Declines in the stock market were closely aligned with oil price surges, reflecting investor concerns over rising production costs and inflation. The scatter plot further supported this observation, showing a weak but clear negative correlation between oil prices and the S&P 500 index. This indicates that as energy costs rose, market performance suffered, underlining the interconnections of energy markets and financial stability.\n\nFor RQ2, which examined shifts in consumer sentiment, stock market trends, oil prices, and inflation:\n\nThe interactive box plot demonstrated a significant decline in consumer sentiment during the conflict period, likely fueled by inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty. The inverse relationship between rising oil prices and falling sentiment was particularly pronounced, highlighting the economic burden placed on households.\nInflation, as visualized in the animated line plot, surged in early 2022, reflecting rising costs tied to energy markets and supply chain disruptions. While inflation began to stabilize later, its impact on consumer confidence and market volatility persisted, emphasizing the long-term effects of geopolitical instability on economic dynamics.\n\nThese findings highlight the cascading economic risks of geopolitical conflicts. Rising oil prices acted as a catalyst, driving inflation and reducing consumer confidence, which, in turn, contributed to stock market instability. Policymakers and businesses must closely monitor such interconnected variables to better anticipate and mitigate economic shocks in the future.\n\nLimitations\nDespite the valuable insights gained, the analysis faced several limitations. Data quality and coverage posed challenges, as missing values in consumer sentiment and inflation data required imputation, which may have introduced biases. Additionally, the oil price data, while comprehensive, focused on a single metric, potentially limiting the scope of the analysis. Another limitation was the inability to establish causation from the observed correlations. \nWhile the visualizations highlighted relationships between oil prices, stock trends, and consumer sentiment, other factors, such as monetary policy or global economic conditions, may have also influenced the observed trends. Lastly, the granularity of the analysis was limited; the time series and scatter plots captured broad trends but may have missed more nuanced dynamics, such as sector-specific stock market reactions or demographic variations in sentiment.\n\n\nFuture Research\nTo address these limitations and expand the current findings, several areas for future research are proposed. Incorporating additional variables, such as unemployment rates, wage growth, or sector-specific stock indices, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the conflict’s economic impact. Exploring demographic variations in consumer sentiment and inflation expectations could uncover disparities in how different groups were affected economically. Advancing visualization techniques, such as developing interactive dashboards or heatmaps, could enable more granular exploration of trends and patterns across specific time periods or regions. Finally, employing statistical or machine learning models to establish causal links between oil prices, inflation, and stock trends could validate the findings and deepen the analysis, offering a clearer understanding of the underlying relationships.\nIn conclusion, the visualizations effectively captured the interconnectedness of economic indicators during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, underscoring the profound impact of geopolitical events on domestic markets and public sentiment. While the findings provide actionable insights, addressing the limitations and exploring additional dimensions could further enhance understanding and inform policy responses to future global crises."
